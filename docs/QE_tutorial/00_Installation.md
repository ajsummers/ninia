# 0. Installing Quantum Espresso

Before getting started, you will need to install Quantum Espresso. This guide will lead you through the steps to 
install QE on an **HPC Cluster** and on **Windows**.

## 0.1 HPC Installation

For the HPC Installation, I am assuming that the system's OS is a form of Linux, and you do not have root permissions 
(this installation should work either way, but root permissions may make it simpler).

Quantum Espresso recently (as of version 7.0) started making users register before using their software. So in order to
download QE, you will have to first [register](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/register-user/). You will then be able
to [log in](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/login/) and click the first `Quantum ESPRESSO V.#.#` to download the most 
recent version of QE. You can also choose to download older versions of QE from the same page. In this walkthrough, 
V.7.0 was the most recent.

Once you download QE, move the file `qe-X.X-ReleasePack.tgz` to your desired folder in your HPC Cluster
